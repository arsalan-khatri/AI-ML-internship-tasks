# AI/ML Internship Tasks

This repository contains the solutions for the AI/ML internship tasks. The focus is on building machine learning models for classification and prediction problems.

## 📂 Task 1: Music Recommendation System

### 🎯 Task Objective
To build a machine learning system that predicts whether a user will listen to a specific song again within a set timeframe (1 month). The goal is to solve a binary classification problem (1 = Repeat, 0 = No Repeat).

### 📊 Dataset Used
* **Source:** [Yahan likho dataset kahan se mila, ya "Provided by Internship"]
* **Key Features:** User history, song timestamps, song details.
* **Target Variable:** `target` (1 or 0).

### ⚙️ Models Applied
I experimented with the following algorithms to achieve the best accuracy:
1.  **Logistic Regression:** Used as a baseline model.
2.  **Random Forest Classifier:** To capture complex patterns in user history.
3.  **XGBoost:** For performance optimization.

### 📈 Key Results and Findings
* **Best Model:** Random Forest gave the best accuracy of **[XX]%**.
* **Findings:** Users who listened to a song completely were **[XX]%** more likely to repeat it.
* **Confusion Matrix:** The model successfully identified repeat listeners with high precision.
